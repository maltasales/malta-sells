# Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 1, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Insecure Voice Assistant Component**
   - Deleted: components/AIVoiceAssistant.tsx
   - Reason: Exposed OPENAI_API_KEY in client-side code (dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true)
   - This was a security vulnerability that could expose the API key to users

2. **Kept Secure Implementation**
   - Retained: components/VoiceAssistant.tsx (secure, uses server-side API)
   - Retained: app/api/voice/route.ts (server-side endpoint)
   - API endpoint properly keeps OPENAI_API_KEY server-side only

3. **Removed Orphaned Files**
   - setup-lucia-storage.sql
   - setup-plan-schema.sql
   - setup-storage.sql
   - setup-verification-profile.sql
   - test_result.md
   - Reason: Not referenced anywhere in the codebase

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Added OPENAI_API_KEY placeholder to .env file with instructions
   - API endpoint already has proper error handling for missing key

### Current Architecture

#### Voice Assistant Feature:
- **Frontend Component**: /components/VoiceAssistant.tsx
  - Text input box
  - "Play Voice" button
  - Calls server-side API endpoint

- **Server-side API**: /app/api/voice/route.ts
  - POST endpoint at /api/voice
  - Accepts JSON: { text: "string" }
  - Uses OpenAI TTS model: gpt-4o-mini-tts
  - Voice: alloy
  - Returns: audio/mpeg buffer
  - Properly handles missing API key

- **Integration Page**: /app/voice-test/page.tsx
  - Displays VoiceAssistant component
  - Includes documentation and security notes

### Build Status
✅ Build completes successfully (58 pages generated)
✅ No duplicate components
✅ No insecure API key exposure
✅ All orphaned files removed
✅ Proper error handling in place

### To Enable Voice Assistant:
1. Add your OpenAI API key to .env file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
2. Restart the development server
3. Visit /voice-test to use the feature

### Security Notes:
- API key is NEVER exposed to client-side code
- All OpenAI calls go through secure server-side endpoint
- Client receives only the generated audio, not the API key
