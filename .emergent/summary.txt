The previous AI engineer successfully imported the Malta Sells Next.js project and focused heavily on implementing and stabilizing complex seller plan limits and profile synchronization features, dealing with significant user requirements volatility and underlying database schema constraints (Supabase). Key implemented features include plan-based listing limits (Free: 1, Basic: 5, Pro: 10, Enterprise: 20), consistent display of seller profiles (real name, profile picture) across listings, removal of generic seller placeholders, and conditional visibility of the verification badge (only for paid plans). Iterative fixes were made to the verification flow, eventually removing the modal entirely to simplify the seller experience. The engineer also integrated a full OpenAI Voice Assistant pipeline (Whisper, ChatGPT, TTS) using the user's key into the existing  component. A persistent and critical bug related to user session persistence and database profile creation failures remains noted but unfixed. The work concluded immediately after integrating the AI Voice Assistant functionality into the main UI component.

<product_requirements>
The goal was to enhance the Malta Sells platform by implementing robust seller plan restrictions and improving data consistency.

1.  **Plan Limits & Enforcement**: Sellers must be assigned a default Free Plan (1 active listing limit) upon signup. Basic (5 listings), Pro (10), and Enterprise (20) limits must be enforced. If a seller attempts to exceed their limit, they must be redirected to the Upgrade Your Plan page. Listing cards must include View, Edit, and Delete buttons.
2.  **Seller Verification Flow**: The verification form should only be shown the *first time* a new seller clicks Add Property, then never again. This was later simplified to disable the verification modal completely.
3.  **Profile Synchronization**: All listings and videos must display the sellerâ€™s real name, profile picture, and contact information automatically from their profile. No generic or placeholder names should be used.
4.  **Verification Badge**: The blue verification badge must only be visible for paid plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) and hidden for Free plan users across all public-facing components.
5.  **AI Voice Assistant**: Integrate a complete voice-to-voice AI assistant pipeline (Whisper, ChatGPT, TTS) using the provided OpenAI key into the existing red AI Voice button (LuciaAssistant component) in the bottom navigation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Next.js/React**: Primary development stack for the full-stack application.
-   **Supabase/PostgreSQL**: Used for backend data storage, properties, and profiles.
-   **Plan Management**: Logic implemented in  to define and retrieve plan limits.
-   **OpenAI Integration**: Use of  SDK for Whisper (STT), GPT (response), and TTS (speech output).
-   **In-memory Auth**: The application uses a custom in-memory/localStorage authentication mixed with Supabase profile interaction.

-   : **Plan Definitions.** Defines  with  (Free=1, Basic=5, Pro=10, Enterprise=20). Includes utilities like  and , ensuring fallbacks to prevent runtime errors.
-   : **Core Plan Enforcement.** Updated the  function to check  against  and redirect to  if the limit is reached. Iteratively modified to remove the  logic for simplicity.
-   : **AI Voice Assistant Core.** Heavily rewritten to implement the complete voice-to-voice pipeline (recording, Whisper, ChatGPT, TTS) using the environment variable .
-    & : **Profile/Video Sync.** Modified to fetch and display real seller data (, ) from the profile sync logic, removing all generative fallback names. Also updated to conditionally render the verification badge only for paid plans using .
-   , , , : **Badge Visibility.** Updated across all public-facing components to check the user's plan ID before displaying the blue verification badge.
-   : **Authentication Update.** Modified  logic to attempt saving richer user profile data (including  and  status) to Supabase/localStorage, although Supabase inserts failed due to schema issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix Session Persistence**: Resolve the critical bug causing the user session to be lost between page navigations, resulting in constant redirects to the sign-in page.
-   **Supabase Schema Alignment**: Investigate and fix the recurrent database constraint errors preventing proper user profile creation/updates (e.g., missing  or  columns), which currently forces reliance on local state fallbacks.
-   **Test AI Integration**: Verify the newly integrated AI Voice Assistant functionality within the  component.

<current_work>
The immediate current work involved finalizing the integration of the OpenAI AI Voice Assistant into the Malta Sells application, specifically targeting the existing user interface elements as requested by the user.

1.  **AI Backend Setup**: The user provided an OpenAI API key, which was saved to . The  SDK was installed.
2.  **Temporary Setup**: A temporary test environment ( and a link in ) was initially created but subsequently removed following the user's instructions.
3.  **Final Integration Point**: The core AI logic (voice recording, Whisper transcription, ChatGPT response generation, and TTS playback) was implemented entirely within the  component, which is triggered by the red AI Voice button in the bottom navigation bar.
4.  **Cleanup**: The last executed step was successfully removing the temporary voice test link from , confirming that the AI feature is now exclusively accessed via the existing bottom navigation button.

The application is currently configured to run the voice assistant pipeline using the user's credentials upon interaction with the  modal.
